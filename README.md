# news-api

This project is intended to take on news api assignment using swift with VIPER design architecture.
I managed to to complete step 1 to 5. Unfortunately, the search function only works to search news articles.
I have never implemented VIPER and had difficulties in understanding the architecture.
I hope I could accomplish more than this. Task wise and skill wise.
